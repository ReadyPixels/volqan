## [Unreleased]

Changes staged for the next release are tracked here before a version number is assigned.

### Fixed — May 21, 2026, 4:45 PM

**VOLQ-009** · WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit and remediation. Audited all admin UI pages. Fixed: (A3) added `aria-current="page"` to active nav links in `Sidebar.tsx` (top-level and child links); (A7) added `aria-current="page"` to active links in `MobileNav.tsx` bottom nav and "More" overlay; (A8) added compound `aria-label="${label} — ${description}"` to all QuickActions card links; (A9) added `role="img"` and descriptive `aria-label` to the ContentChart SVG; (A5) added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons in QuickActions. Confirmed: global `:focus-visible` rule is set in `globals.css` (2px outline, 2px offset); MetricTile trend badges already have `aria-label` with direction description from VOLQ-008. Browser-verified: `aria-current`, SVG roles, and `aria-label` all present in DOM.

---

### Added — May 21, 2026, 4:22 PM

**VOLQ-008** · Added `AnalyticsWidget` to the admin dashboard. The widget shows three metrics — Page Views, API Requests, and Peak Active Users — each in a tile with a 30-day sparkline (pure SVG, no library), trend percentage vs. the previous 30 days, and a coloured icon. Data is deterministic mock values seeded by day index anchored to May 20 2026 (same approach as ContentChart). The widget is placed between the ContentChart and the main dashboard grid. A "Mock data" chip and "Settings → Analytics" link signal to operators that the data will be replaced by a real provider (Plausible, GA4, or internal) once configured. All data is computed at module init time — no `useEffect`, no `Math.random()`.

---

### Added — May 21, 2026, 9:57 AM

**VOLQ-007** · Wired real SQLite database for local development. Converted `packages/core/prisma/schema.prisma` provider from `postgresql` to `sqlite` (enums and Json fields replaced with `String` for SQLite compatibility; comments preserve valid values). Created `packages/core/.env` (`DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db`) and `packages/admin/.env.local` (`DATABASE_URL=file:C:/...absolute path.../dev.db` — absolute path required because Next.js detects the monorepo root as the workspace root). Ran `prisma db push` (creates `packages/core/prisma/dev.db`, 258KB) and `prisma db seed` (creates admin user `admin@volqan.link` and 8 default settings). Created `packages/admin/src/lib/db.ts` — dev-singleton PrismaClient using the workspace's hoisted `@prisma/client`. Created `packages/admin/src/app/api/content-types/route.ts` — GET (list with entry count) and POST (create with slug uniqueness check). Updated `packages/admin/src/app/content/types/page.tsx` to fetch from `/api/content-types` instead of mock data (shows loading state, empty state, and real records). Updated `packages/admin/src/app/content/types/new/page.tsx` to POST to the API on save (slug derived from name). Browser-verified: created "Article" content type; survived full page refresh.

---

### Added — May 21, 2026, 9:33 AM

**VOLQ-006** · Implemented stateless HMAC-SHA256 stub authentication for the admin panel. Created `packages/admin/src/lib/stub-auth.ts` (Web Crypto API, Edge-compatible token sign/verify), `packages/admin/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (POST: validates `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars, sets `volqan_session` httpOnly cookie), `packages/admin/src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` (POST: clears cookie), `packages/admin/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (email + password form with inline error state), and `packages/admin/src/middleware.ts` (Next.js Edge middleware: reads and verifies `volqan_session`, redirects to `/login` if missing or invalid, excludes `/login` and `/api/auth/` from protection). The `AdminShell` is updated to detect the `/login` pathname via `usePathname()` and render a clean full-page centered layout without the sidebar or topbar. The top bar "Sign out" button now calls `POST /api/auth/logout` and redirects to `/login`. Default credentials: `admin@volqan.link` / `changeme` (overridable via `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars).

---

### Fixed — May 20, 2026, 4:50 PM

**VOLQ-001** · Billing: Corrected yearly plan savings badge from "Save 17% vs monthly" to "Save 20% vs monthly". The correct calculation is $5/mo × 12 = $60/yr vs $48/yr → 20% savings. Updated both the `savingsBadge` prop and the introductory paragraph in `packages/admin/src/app/billing/page.tsx`.

**VOLQ-002** · Attribution footer now correctly hidden when attribution removal is active. Extracted `MOCK_SUBSCRIPTION` into `packages/admin/src/lib/mock-subscription.ts` as a shared module. `AdminShell` now reads `attributionRemoved` from this module and conditionally omits `<ClientAttributionFooter />`. Both `AdminShell` and `BillingPage` now use the same source of truth.

**VOLQ-003** · ContentChart total count is now deterministic across page loads. Replaced `Math.random()` in `generateData()` with a seeded integer hash (`(seed * 1103515245 + 12345) & 0x7fffffff`) anchored to a fixed reference date (May 20, 2026), eliminating the jarring per-load variation (was: 186–214; now: always 195).

**VOLQ-004** · "View Live Site" Quick Action no longer links to the admin root (`/`). Now links to `https://example.com` (the default mock site URL from Settings). Will resolve to the user-configured Site URL once the Settings API is wired.

**VOLQ-005** · `docs/roadmap.md` updated to accurately reflect the current build state. Phase 1 items that have been implemented are now marked ✅; items with UI-only or partial implementation are marked 🔄; Phase 2 built items (page builder, AI assistant, dark mode, mobile, official extensions, Stripe UI) are now ✅; Phase 3 SDK items are 🔄 (built, not yet published). Last-updated date corrected from April 2026 to May 20, 2026.

### Added — May 20, 2026, 4:50 PM

**VOLQ-000** · Created `docs/Tasks.md` — project-level task tracker with VOLQ-NNN IDs, acceptance criteria, and priority order aligned to the public roadmap. Covers bug fixes VOLQ-001 through VOLQ-005, Phase 1 blockers (auth, database), and planned Phase 2/3 milestones.

### Security

**Admin Panel (`packages/admin`)**
- Fixed XSS vulnerability in `HtmlBlock` and `RichTextBlock` page builder components — raw HTML from block props was passed directly to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; replaced with an allowlist-based `sanitizeHtml()` function that strips disallowed tags and removes all `on*` event handler and `javascript:` attributes
- Fixed XSS vulnerability in `AIMessage` markdown renderer — user-supplied content was regex-substituted then passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without escaping, allowing injected HTML and `javascript:` link URIs; input is now HTML-escaped before pattern matching and link `href` values are validated to `http`/`https` only
- Fixed `rel="noopener noreferrer"` missing `noreferrer` on AI-generated external links (previously only `noopener`), which allowed target pages to read the `Referer` header
- Fixed open redirect in billing checkout — `window.location.href` was set directly from an unvalidated API response URL; now validates the URL is `https:` and the hostname ends with `.stripe.com` before redirecting
- Restricted `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts` — replaced the overly broad `**.cloudflare.com` wildcard (matches any Cloudflare subdomain) with the specific `imagedelivery.net` hostname
- Added HTTP security response headers to all routes via `next.config.ts`: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`

---

## [Post-0.0.1 Development] — April–May 2026

> Work completed after the initial public release but before the first runnable version tag. Documents the full implementation of the admin panel, core runtime, SDKs, CLI, and developer ecosystem built in preparation for `v0.1.0-alpha`.

- Checkout page with plan toggle (Yearly / Monthly with 25% monthly uplift), feature list, and Stripe redirect guard

**Bug Fixes — Admin Panel**
- Resolved webpack build error (`Can't resolve 'child_process'`) caused by `@volqan/core` barrel import pulling `sharp` (a Node.js-only native module) into the browser bundle — fixed by inlining marketplace URLs in `extensions/page.tsx` and `themes/page.tsx` and adding `sharp: false` / `detect-libc: false` webpack aliases for client builds in `next.config.ts`; removed `transpilePackages: ['@volqan/core']` which was the root cause of core being traversed by webpack
- Fixed React hydration mismatch on the dashboard — `ContentChart` was calling `Math.random()` and `new Date()` at module scope, producing different values on server and client; moved data generation into `useState` + `useEffect` so it only runs after hydration
- Added `public/favicon.svg` (Volqan logo — orange-to-red gradient M/volcano mark with flame and sparks) and wired it via `metadata.icons` in `app/layout.tsx` to resolve the 404 on `/favicon.ico`
- Fixed stat card percentage badges invisible in light mode — root cause was Tailwind v4 defaulting `dark:` variants to `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` regardless of the `.dark` class on `<html>`
