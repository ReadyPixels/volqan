# Volqan — Task List

All outstanding work identified across the codebase audit (May 2026).

---

## In Progress

- [x] Cut **v0.1.0-alpha** GitHub release — published 2026-04-05 at <https://github.com/ReadyPixels/volqan/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha>
- [x] Complete documentation on GitHub Pages — live at <https://volqan.link/>, deployed via `deploy-docs.yml` workflow, HTTPS certificate approved

---

## Security

- [x] **API keys**: SHA-256 hash stored instead of plaintext — `key` field stores digest, raw key returned only once on creation (`packages/admin/src/app/api/settings/api-keys/route.ts`)
- [x] Rate limiting added to `POST /api/auth/login` — 10 attempts per 15 min per IP via in-memory sliding window (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`); also applied to forgot-password and reset-password routes
- [x] CSRF: `SameSite=Lax` + `HttpOnly` is sufficient for same-origin admin use (admin panel is same-origin only; no cross-origin form POST attack surface). Documented in middleware.
- [x] `Secure` flag added to session cookie in production environments (`api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- [x] File upload MIME type validation — media upload route enforces upload-root boundaries and blocks HTML/SVG/JS/executable content (`packages/admin/src/app/api/media/route.ts`)
- [x] Scriptable uploads blocked — upload route rejects `.html`, `.svg`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.php` and other browser-executable extensions
- [x] Validate uploaded file type by reading magic bytes (content-based validation), not just client-supplied MIME/extension — implemented via `MAGIC` lookup table in `packages/admin/src/app/api/media/route.ts`; rejects files whose content doesn't match declared extension
- [x] API key scope validated against allowlist on creation; non-admin users cannot escalate permissions (`packages/admin/src/app/api/settings/api-keys/route.ts`)
- [x] Media ownership enforced — non-admin users can only list/read their own uploads (`packages/admin/src/app/api/media/route.ts`, `packages/admin/src/app/api/media/[id]/route.ts`)

---

## Authentication & Users

- [x] OAuth callback routes — `GET /api/auth/oauth/[provider]` redirects to provider; `GET /api/auth/oauth/[provider]/callback` handles code exchange, creates/links accounts, sets session cookie. Supports Google and GitHub.
- [x] Email verification flow — `POST /api/auth/verify-email` verifies HMAC-signed token and sets `emailVerified`. Token generation helper exported from the route.
- [x] Password reset flow — `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` generates signed reset token (logs URL in dev); `POST /api/auth/reset-password` verifies token and updates password.
- [x] Invite email — `POST /api/users` now sends an invite email via `src/lib/email.ts`; supports Resend (`EMAIL_TRANSPORT=resend` + `RESEND_API_KEY`) or console fallback in dev; also fixed `passwordHash` → `password` field name bug in the route
- [x] User profile edit page (`/profile`) — full profile page with name/avatar editor and password change form; backed by `PATCH /api/auth/me`

---

## Admin Pages (Mock → Real API)

- [x] **AI Assistant** (`packages/admin/src/app/ai/page.tsx`) — page created; opens AI panel with `initialOpen`; provider config saved to `/api/settings` as `ai_provider` key

---

## Product Design Hardening

### Critical

- [x] **PD-001**: Restore admin typecheck health before design QA — all typecheck failures fixed: Installation billing fields added to Prisma schema (+ migration), `Prisma.InputJsonValue` namespaces, shared `src/lib/content.ts` repo/schema singletons, Sidebar nav typing, CSS/node-saml declarations in `src/types/globals.d.ts`, StorageProvider casing, `onManage` prop (`packages/admin`)
- [x] **PD-002**: Fix Media Library real-data flow — mocks removed; upload/delete via real API with loading, error, retry, empty, filtered-empty, permission, and success states; delete uses ConfirmDialog (`packages/admin/src/app/media/page.tsx`)
- [x] **PD-003**: Replace mock content entries with live API data — entries fetched from `/api/content/[type]`, status counts from real data, delete/bulk delete via API with confirm dialog, all async states covered (`packages/admin/src/app/content/[slug]/page.tsx`); entry editor also wired to real GET/PATCH/DELETE (`[id]/page.tsx`)
- [x] **PD-004**: Replace mock page editor persistence with live API data — loads via `GET /api/pages/[id]`, saves via `PATCH`, publishes via `PATCH { status: 'published' }`, shows save/publish failure recovery banners (`packages/admin/src/app/pages/[id]/page.tsx`)

### High

- [x] **PD-005**: Add consistent admin status-state patterns — shared `LoadingState`/`ErrorState`/`EmptyState`/`PermissionDeniedState` components in `src/components/ui/async-states.tsx`, applied across media, content, page editor, and entry editor; success/error banners use `role="status"`/`role="alert"` (`packages/admin`)
- [x] **PD-006**: Replace native destructive `confirm()` prompts with accessible Volqan dialogs — new `ConfirmDialog` (`src/components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`) with entity names, consequences, loading states; wired into content delete/bulk delete, media delete, user remove, API key revoke, billing cancel, extension uninstall (`packages/admin`)
- [x] **PD-007**: Complete English/Arabic product support — `LocaleProvider` drives `<html lang>` and `dir` from saved `site.locale` (localStorage + settings API); RTL overrides in `globals.css` for sidebar/nav/tooltips/mono fields; settings save applies locale immediately; locale choices remain EN/AR only (`packages/admin`)
- [x] **PD-008**: Complete mobile navigation coverage — Analytics, Billing, AI Assistant, and Profile added to the mobile More menu with `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` (`packages/admin/src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx`)
- [x] **PD-009**: Remove fake operational affordances — top-bar notifications now show real audit-log activity; top-bar search is a working quick-nav across admin pages; installation info served live from new `GET /api/settings/installation`; storage tab limited to Local with S3 shown as clearly unavailable; inert "Send test email" disabled with explanation (`packages/admin`)

### Medium

- [x] **PD-010**: Add product-design regression tests — Playwright suite at `packages/admin/e2e/admin-regression.spec.ts` covering login, dashboard, content, media upload/delete, users invite, settings, theme switching, keyboard navigation, destructive dialogs, and mobile navigation; run via `pnpm --filter @volqan/admin test:e2e` (requires `playwright install` + live DB)
- [x] **PD-011**: Add accessibility verification beyond static markup — `packages/admin/e2e/a11y.spec.ts` runs axe-core WCAG 2.1 AA scans on core pages plus keyboard operability, dialog focus/Escape, Arabic RTL flip, and reduced-motion checks
- [x] **PD-012**: Add Product Design saved context for future audits — documented at `docs/product-design-context.md` (surfaces, routes, tokens, component paths, EN/AR requirement, test targets)

---

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- [x] Prisma migrations committed — initial migration SQL generated from schema at `packages/core/prisma/migrations/init/migration.sql`; `migration_lock.toml` added; run `prisma migrate deploy` against a live database to apply
- [ ] Apply pending Prisma migration `installation_billing_fields` (Stripe billing fields on `Installation`) via `prisma migrate deploy` against the live database, same as the existing `init` migration
- [x] Renamed all Prisma migration folders from timestamp-prefixed (`20260405000000_init`, etc.) to plain descriptive names (`init`, `webhooks_scheduling`, `installation_billing_fields`) (packages/core)
- [ ] **Verify before next deploy**: if CI's `DATABASE_URL` points at a persistent database that already ran `prisma migrate deploy` under the old timestamped folder names, the `_prisma_migrations` table will show those migrations as unapplied under the new names. Either rename the corresponding rows in that table to match, or confirm the target database has never been migrated yet.

---

## Phase 2 Remaining (roadmap)

- [x] Analytics overview widget — `GET /api/analytics` + `/analytics` page with daily activity chart and top actions breakdown (`packages/admin`)

## Security Remediation (2026-06-14 Audit)

### Critical

- [x] **SEC-001**: Whitelist `orderBy`/`direction` in content list route — `packages/admin/src/app/api/content/[type]/route.ts`
- [x] **SEC-002**: Replace in-memory rate limiter with Redis-backed implementation — `packages/admin/src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
- [x] **SEC-003**: Require `CRON_SECRET` — return 503 when unset — `packages/admin/src/app/api/cron/content-scheduler/route.ts`

### High

- [x] **SEC-004**: Add `Content-Security-Policy` header to `next.config.ts`
- [x] **SEC-005**: Throw error if `SESSION_SECRET` is unset in production (token routes)
- [x] **SEC-006**: Remove `localhost:4000` from `serverActions.allowedOrigins`
- [x] **H-2**: Use cryptographically random `oauth_state` with `Secure` flag in production
- [x] **H-3**: Create `SECURITY.md` at repo root with vulnerability reporting instructions
- [x] **H-5**: Fix user enumeration timing in OAuth callback
- [x] **H-1**: Switch password reset to code-based flow — forgot-password now emails a 6-digit code (HMAC stored server-side with 15-min expiry and 5-attempt lockout); reset-password takes `{ email, code, password }` in the POST body, no token in URL; frontend pages updated (`packages/admin`)

### Medium

- [x] **SEC-007**: Add request body size limits to JSON API routes
- [x] **SEC-008**: Invalidate all sessions on password change
- [x] **SEC-010**: Add `client_max_body_size` note to deployment docs for nginx
- [x] **M-1**: Enforce `Content-Length` limits via middleware wrapper
- [x] **M-2**: Ensure temp password response is HTTPS-only with change-on-first-login requirement
- [x] **SEC-009**: Add CORS configuration for public API routes — middleware handles OPTIONS preflight and sets `Access-Control-*` headers on `/api/v1/*` and `/api/health`; origins configurable via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env (default `*` for credential-free public endpoints)

### Low

- [x] **SEC-012**: Clean up `.gitignore` — fix `CLAUDE.md` entry
- [x] **L-3**: Verify `scripts/postgres/init.sql` exists or document as optional

---

## Cleanup Infrastructure

### High

- [x] **CLN-001**: Create `.tmp/` directory at project root for temporary session files
- [x] **CLN-002**: Create `.claude/cleanup.ps1` — runs at end of session: deletes `.tmp/` contents, removes stale `.claude/worktrees/`, reports what was cleaned
- [x] **CLN-003**: Add cleanup instructions section to `CLAUDE.md` — instruct Claude to run cleanup script and use `.tmp/` for all temporary files

---

## Documentation

- [x] **DOC-001**: Refactor `docs/changelog.md` from version-based to date-based format
- [x] **DOC-002**: Update `CLAUDE.md` changelog section to reference date-based format
