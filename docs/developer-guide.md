## SDK Packages

Volqan provides two SDK packages for developers:

### @volqan/extension-sdk

The Extension SDK provides everything needed to build, test, and publish Volqan extensions.

```bash
pnpm add @volqan/extension-sdk
```

**Includes:**

- Re-exported types from `@volqan/core` (`VolqanExtension`, `ExtensionContext`, etc.)
- `defineExtension()` helper for type-safe extension definitions
- `createAdminPage()`, `registerContentType()`, `registerRoute()` utilities
- Testing utilities: `createTestContext()`, `mockVolqanApp()`
- CLI tooling for scaffolding, building, and local development

### @volqan/theme-sdk

The Theme SDK provides everything needed to build, preview, and publish Volqan themes.

```bash
pnpm add @volqan/theme-sdk
```

**Includes:**

- Re-exported types from `@volqan/core` (`VolqanTheme`, `ComponentOverride`, etc.)
- `defineTheme()` helper with typed CSS token definitions
- Component override system for customizing shadcn/ui components
- Live preview development server
- Token validation (catches missing required tokens before publish)

---

## CLI Scaffolding

The Volqan CLI can scaffold new extension and theme projects:

```bash
# Create a new extension
npx @volqan/cli create extension my-extension

# Create a new theme
npx @volqan/cli create theme my-theme
```

Both commands generate a fully working, buildable project with TypeScript, proper `package.json` dependencies, and boilerplate source files.

```

**Key concepts:**

- **Extensions** are npm packages that export a `VolqanExtension` object. They can add routes, admin pages, content hooks, dashboard widgets, and more.
- **Themes** are npm packages that export a `VolqanTheme` object. They inject design tokens as CSS custom properties under the `--volqan-*` namespace.
- **The Extension Engine** loads, validates, sandboxes, and lifecycle-manages extensions.
- **The Theme Engine** injects theme tokens on the `<html>` element and handles component overrides.
- **Bazarix** ([bazarix.dev](https://bazarix.dev)) is the official marketplace for distributing extensions and themes.
